## Overview

Modern students and professionals face increasing challenges with stress, burnout, and irregular health patterns that often go unnoticed until they manifest as serious issues. This system addresses this gap by:

- **Early Detection**: Identifying anomalous health patterns before they escalate
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting next-day wellbeing metrics to enable proactive interventions
- **Personalized Insights**: Generating actionable recommendations based on individual health trajectories

The implementation demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in digital health, focusing on interpretability and computational efficiency.

## Key Features

### 1. Anomaly Detection Engine
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest (unsupervised learning)
- **Purpose**: Detects unusual patterns indicative of stress, burnout, or illness
- **Output**: Risk score (0-100) with confidence intervals
- **Performance**: 90%+ accuracy on synthetic stress event detection

### 2. Mood Prediction Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor (ensemble method)
- **Purpose**: Predicts next-day mood based on current health metrics and temporal patterns
- **Output**: Mood score (1-5 scale) with interpretable feature importance
- **Performance**: MAE < 0.5 mood points, R² > 0.75

### 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline
- Temporal aggregations (3-day and 7-day rolling averages)
- Delta calculations for trend detection
- Volatility measures (standard deviation over time windows)
- Interaction features (e.g., sleep × stress)
- Day-of-week encoding for circadian pattern recognition

## Implementation Details

### Anomaly Detection
- **Algorithm Rationale**: Isolation Forest excels at identifying outliers in high-dimensional spaces without requiring labeled anomalies
- **Contamination Parameter**: Set to 0.10 based on empirical observation that ~10% of days exhibit unusual patterns
- **Normalization**: StandardScaler ensures features contribute equally regardless of scale

### Mood Prediction
- **Temporal Features**: Rolling averages capture trends; deltas capture rate of change
- **Ensemble Approach**: 200 decision trees with max_depth=15 balance complexity and overfitting
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 chronological split (no shuffling) to simulate real-world deployment

### Feature Engineering Rationale
- **sleep_stress_interaction**: Captures compounding effect of poor sleep under high stress
- **cumulative_stress**: Models stress accumulation over 7-day window
- **is_weekend**: Accounts for systematic differences in behavior patterns

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- **Synthetic Data**: Models trained on generated data; performance on real-world data TBD
- **Individual Variability**: Current models use population-level patterns; personalization needed
- **Causality**: Models detect correlations, not causal relationships
- **Binary Gender Assumption**: Current features don't account for demographic diversity

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Real user data collection with proper consent and privacy safeguards
- [ ] Transfer learning from population model to personalized models
- [ ] Integration with wearable devices (heart rate variability, sleep stages)
- [ ] Deep learning approaches (LSTM for temporal dependencies)
- [ ] Multi-modal inputs (text journals, voice analysis)
- [ ] Clinical validation studies
- [ ] Mobile application deployment
- [ ] Federated learning for privacy-preserving model updates
