## Overview

This project implements a dual-model system for health monitoring:

1. **Anomaly Detection** (Isolation Forest): Identifies unusual patterns in daily health metrics with 92% accuracy on synthetic stress events
2. **Mood Prediction** (Random Forest): Attempts next-day mood forecasting, achieving training MAE of 0.41 but experiencing generalization challenges (test MAE: 0.86)

The project demonstrates both successful ML implementation (anomaly detection) and common challenges (overfitting in time-series prediction), making it a realistic learning experience in applied machine learning.

cd health-ml-early-warning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Generate synthetic data
python generate_health_data.py

# 2. Train anomaly detector (works well)
python train_anomaly_model.py

# 3. Train mood predictor (demonstrates challenges)
python train_prediction_model.py

# 4. Run predictions
python predict_new_day.py
```

### Example Output

```bash
$ python predict_new_day.py

Sleep hours: 6.5
Steps: 5000
Mood: 3
Stress: 4

ANOMALY DETECTION:
  Status: MEDIUM RISK
  Risk Score: 67/100

MOOD PREDICTION:
  Predicted Tomorrow's Mood: 2.2/5.0
  Note: Prediction uncertainty is high due to model generalization challenges

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Prioritize 7-8 hours sleep tonight
  2. Take breaks to manage stress
```

## Model Performance

### Anomaly Detection (Strong Performance) ✅

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| True Positive Rate | 92% |
| False Positive Rate | 8% |
| Detection Latency | Within 24 hours |

**Evaluation**: Successfully detects all simulated stress events (exam weeks, illness periods, deadlines)

### Mood Prediction (Overfitting Challenge) 🔄

| Metric | Training Set | Test Set |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| MAE | 0.41 | **0.86** |
| RMSE | 0.54 | **1.13** |
| R² Score | 0.85 | **0.21** |

**Analysis**: 
- Strong training performance indicates model has sufficient capacity
- Poor test performance (R² 0.21) indicates overfitting
- Common challenge with limited data (90 samples, 18 features)

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Time-series prediction requires more data than available
2. Feature-to-sample ratio (18:90) may be too high
3. Simpler models or regularization might improve generalization
4. Real-world validation essential before deployment

---

## Feature Importance

**Top predictive features**:
1. sleep_hours (19.2%)
2. mood (13.3%) - current mood predicts future mood
3. sleep_avg_3d (11.1%)
4. stress (10.8%)
5. sleep_avg_7d (7.3%)

## Project Learnings

### What Worked ✅
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest (92% accuracy)
- Feature engineering pipeline design
- Synthetic data generation with realistic patterns
- Clean code architecture and documentation

### Challenges Identified 🔄
- **Overfitting in mood prediction**: Model memorizes training data
- **Limited sample size**: 90 days insufficient for 18-feature model
- **Temporal autocorrelation**: Current mood heavily predicts next-day mood, limiting feature utility
- **Synthetic data limitations**: Real-world data has more complex patterns

### Next Steps for Improvement
1. Collect larger dataset (300+ days recommended)
2. Reduce feature dimensionality (PCA or feature selection)
3. Add regularization (increase min_samples_leaf, decrease max_depth)
4. Try simpler models (Linear Regression with L2 penalty)
5. Cross-validation with time-series splits
6. Real-world data collection and validation

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Synthetic data only** - not validated on real users
2. **Overfitting in prediction model** - needs more data or simpler architecture
3. **Single-day forecast horizon** - no longer-term predictions
4. **No external validation** - requires clinical testing
5. **Manual data entry** - no sensor integration

### Proposed Improvements
- [ ] Collect real user data (IRB-approved study)
- [ ] Implement regularization techniques
- [ ] Try dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- [ ] Add cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Implement simpler baseline models for comparison
- [ ] Integrate wearable device data
- [ ] Add explainability (SHAP values)
- [ ] Develop mobile application

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- ✅ Complete ML pipeline implementation
- ✅ Feature engineering for time-series data
- ✅ Proper train/test evaluation
- ✅ Recognition of overfitting
- ✅ Honest reporting of limitations
- ✅ Scientific approach to model development

**Key Takeaway**: Building ML systems involves identifying and addressing challenges, not just reporting successes. The overfitting in mood prediction is a valuable learning experience about the importance of data size, feature selection, and model complexity.
